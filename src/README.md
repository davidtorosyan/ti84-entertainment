## Programs

### [CHECK](CHECK.8xp.txt)
Compares two equations for equality, first derivate, or second derivate.

Very rudimentary, checks one data point.

### [CMAT](CMAT.8xp.txt)
Solves complex matrices.

### [COIN](COIN.8xp.txt)
Flips a coin.

Animated and (probably) fair.

### [COLLIDE](COLLIDE.8xp.txt)
A prototype for a game with gravity and bounds collision.

### [GAMEPACK](GAMEPACK.8xp.txt)
A variety pack of Pong, Race, Snake, Stacker, and Timing.

Race and Timing are original games, the others are remakes of classic arcade games.

### [LISTS](LISTS.8xp.txt)
Clears list variables.

### [NDERIV](NDERIV.8xp.txt) & [TAYLOR](TAYLOR.8xp.txt)
Computes Taylor series.

Mostly an experiment in running subprocedures and is buggy.

### [VARS](VARS.8xp.txt)
Configure useful variables for Chemistry or Physics.

### [VECTORS2](VECTORS2.8xp.txt)
Compute dot or cross product of vectors.
